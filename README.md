# Deep learning-based brain ventricle segmentation in Computed Tomography using domain adaptation
# Project Overview
This project focuses on the accurate segmentation of brain ventricles from CT scans, crucial for clinical procedures such as ventriculostomy. This process is essential in acute settings where controlling intracranial pressure is necessary, and CT imaging is most commonly available.

# Challenges
CT scans lack publicly available, well-annotated databases, unlike MRI, which are essential for developing robust brain segmentation algorithms. Additionally, intuitive confidence measures are needed for segmentation results from automated algorithms like deep learning.

# Solution: Uncertainty-aware Domain Adaptation
We propose an end-to-end uncertainty-aware domain adaptation technique that combines translation models and anatomical segmentation, using unpaired MRI and CT scans without segmentation ground truths.

## Techniques and Models Used:
# Translation Models:
Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN): [CycleGAN GitHub](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/tree/master)
Contrastive Learning for Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation (CUT): [CUT GitHub](https://github.com/taesungp/contrastive-unpaired-translation)
Unpaired Neural Schr√∂dinger Bridge (UNSB): [UNSB GitHub](https://github.com/cyclomon/UNSB/tree/main)
# Segmentation Models: 
Our segmentation phase employed an attention-based residual recurrent U-Net architecture, compared with traditional U-Net and ResNet. For more information on the base segmentation model, see [R2AU-Net](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/scn/2021/6625688/).
Stability and Consistency: Given CycleGAN's known challenges with stability and structural consistency, we assessed various methods to enhance translation and segmentation performance during our end-to-end training process.
Confidence Measures: We incorporated Monte Carlo dropouts in both MRI-to-CT translation and CT segmentation phases to provide an intuitive interpretation of the segmentation results.
# Inspiration
Our model's design is inspired by [SynSeg-Net](https://github.com/MASILab/SynSeg-Net/tree/df3c26146a36d8ff329917e2d12a79b42bbb6614), aimed at synthesizing and segmenting anatomical structures in medical imaging. Details on this inspiration can be found here: SynSeg-Net GitHub.

# Conclusion
Our innovative approach aims to segment CT ventricles without ground truths, using only MRI and MRI labels. All labels for the test dataset and part of the training were created with the label fusion technique. This strategy enhances the reliability and applicability of CT-based segmentation in clinical settings.
